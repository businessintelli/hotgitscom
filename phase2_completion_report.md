- **Resume Model**: Resume file management with parsing status and AI analysis
- **Skill Models**: Skills taxonomy with candidate-skill and job-skill relationships
- **Message Model**: Internal messaging system between users
- **Analytics Model**: User analytics and metrics tracking
- **Notification Model**: System notifications and alerts

**Key Features:**
- Hybrid database approach supporting both structured and unstructured data
- JSON fields for AI-generated insights and flexible data storage
- Comprehensive relationships and foreign key constraints
- Built-in audit trails with created_at and updated_at timestamps
- Optimized indexing for search and query performance

### 2. Flask Backend Architecture

**Framework Selection:**
- **Flask** chosen over Django for better flexibility and microservices architecture
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** for robust ORM capabilities
- **Flask-JWT-Extended** for secure authentication
- **Flask-CORS** for cross-origin resource sharing

**Application Structure:**

```

### 3. Authentication System Implementation

**Security Features:**
- **JWT-based authentication** with access and refresh tokens
- **Password hashing** using Werkzeug's secure methods
- **Password strength validation** with complexity requirements
- **Email format validation** and duplicate prevention
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) for different user types

**Authentication Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration with role-specific profiles
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication with token generation
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh mechanism
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Secure logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Current user profile retrieval
- `POST /api/auth/change-password` - Password change functionality

### 4. Core API Endpoints

**Job Management:**
- `GET /api/jobs` - Job listing with advanced filtering and pagination
- `GET /api/jobs/{id}` - Individual job details with view tracking
- `POST /api/jobs` - Job creation (recruiters only)
- `PUT /api/jobs/{id}` - Job updates (recruiters only)
- `DELETE /api/jobs/{id}` - Job deletion (recruiters only)

**Application Management:**
- `GET /api/applications` - Application listing for users
- `POST /api/applications` - Job application submission
- `GET /api/applications/{id}` - Application details
- `PUT /api/applications/{id}/status` - Status updates (recruiters only)

**Features Implemented:**
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Pagination for large datasets
- Role-based access control
- Data validation and error handling
- Comprehensive error responses with detailed messages
